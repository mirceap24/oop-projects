### Title:

Polynomial Calculator in C++

### Description:

A C++ project implementing a Polynomial Calculator using classes and dynamic memory allocation. The calculator supports operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials. It also provides functionality for calculating the value of a polynomial at a given point.

### Features:

- Object-Oriented implementation using C++ classes and dynamic memory allocation.

- Implements two classes: `Polinom` and `Polinom_Dinamic`, where the former represents a polynomial as a one-dimensional array and the latter as a linked list of (coefficient, exponent) pairs.

- Supports basic polynomial operations:

  - Addition (using overloaded `+` operator)
  - Subtraction (using overloaded `-` operator)
  - Multiplication (using overloaded `*` operator)

* Includes methods for reading, storing, and displaying multiple polynomial objects.

* Provides a method for calculating the value of a polynomial at a given point.

* Interactive menu for user input and performing operations.

* Utilizes constructors for initialization and copy, and a destructor for dynamic memory deallocation.

* Overloads `<<` and `>>` operators for easy input and output of polynomial objects.
