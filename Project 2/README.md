## Project: Rental Contract Management System

This project aims to create a system for managing rental contracts, consisting of a `Contract` class and its derived class `ContractRental`. Additionally, a `Folder` class will be created to hold a vector of pointers to `ContractRental` objects and a number of rental contracts. The project will read contracts from a folder, display them, and calculate the total revenue for each contract based on its period, as well as the total revenue collected.
